    <h2>What Is Calculus?</h2>
    <p>
        Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on change and motion. It is divided into two main sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Differential Calculus</strong> – Concerned with the concept of a derivative, which represents the rate of change.</li>
        <li><strong>Integral Calculus</strong> – Focused on the accumulation of quantities, typically represented as areas under curves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Understanding these concepts is critical, as calculus forms the foundation for fields like physics, engineering, economics, and data science.
